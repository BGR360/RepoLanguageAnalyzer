# RepoLanguageAnalyzer
Python script to generate a pie chart of which languages are used in a GitHub user's repos.

This was my first attempt at doing something cool with the GitHub API. I think it turned out well :)

## My Code Distribution

These are the languages I use most frequently in my repositories, according to my script (why does the color for Java have to be so ugly??):
